Hello there ðŸ‘‹  
Welcome to Booty's documentation page!


## Who is Booty?

Booty is a **moderation bot** for removing inactive members, which you can filter by 'x' days.


## Features

Booty kicks inactive members after x days. If a member:

-   Hasn't messaged in x days.

-   Did not join a voice room.

-   Did not put any emoji reaction on a message.


You can specify the number of days and grant access for the slash commands (Booty requires kick permissions). Booty will track your members' activity while using minimal data.
