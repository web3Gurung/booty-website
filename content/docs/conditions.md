1. Booty can only kick members after being on your server for a while. For example, to remove inactive members after 60 days, it will work 60 days after he arrives at your server.

2. Booty uses intents for kicking, the use of slash commands, and the “Server Members Intent” to update his database. He was extensively tested by other devs and normal users on test servers. If you find bugs, kindly join his support discord and let us know.

3. Drawings were ordered from the artist “alifia”. You may not use them without her written (and paid for!) permission. You can find her on Fiverr. She’ll be happy to work with you if you need any cartoonish avatar.

4. The bot is hosted on a reliable server, so he can handle all requests and is available 24/7.
