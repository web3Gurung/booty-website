1.  Whitelist people

Booty **will never try to kick or track other bots** or system users. Still, you might want certain people to be ignored by Booty. Simply use:

-   `/whitelist_add + user`

-   `/whitelist_check`

-   `/whitelist_remove + user`

2.  Whitelist roles

To whitelist entire roles simply go to your server settings -> roles then move the role(s) in question above the booty role. Booty will not kick anyone whose top role is higher than his own. Note: users with admin privileges will not be kicked nor be listed as being kicked.
