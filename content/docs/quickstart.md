## Quickstart guide

1. Invite Booty
2. Run `/diagnose` - Diagnose checks if booty has all permissions it needs.

When booty can't see a channel, **maybe** because it does not have the view access to it, then it can miss recording some activities. 

In that case, simply include his role in the private channel and turn “View Channel” and “Send Message” permissions for his role.
